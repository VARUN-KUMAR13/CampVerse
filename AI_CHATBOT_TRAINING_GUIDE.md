  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",

      ],
      max_tokens: 200,
      temperature: 0.7
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.choices[0].message.content;
};
```

#### **Option B: Google Gemini Integration**
```javascript
// Alternative with Google Gemini
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-gemini-api-key';
const getGeminiResponse = async (message) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}`, {

          text: `You are CampVerse AI assistant. ${message}`
        }]
      }]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;
};
```

### 2. **Context-Aware Responses**

#### **User Role Detection:**
```javascript
// Detect user role and provide relevant responses

    student: "You are helping a student navigate CampVerse platform...",
    faculty: "You are assisting a faculty member with platform features...",
    admin: "You are supporting an administrator with system management..."
  };
  
  return contextualPrompts[userRole] + message;
};
```

#### **Session Memory:**
```javascript
// Remember conversation context
const conversationContext = {
  previousQueries: [],
  userPreferences: {},
  currentTopic: null
};

const getContextualResponse = (message, context) => {
  // Use previous conversation to provide better responses
  const relatedQueries = context.previousQueries.filter(q => 
    q.toLowerCase().includes(message.toLowerCase())
  );
  
  // Provide more relevant suggestions based on history
};
```

### 3. **Multilingual Support**

#### **Language Detection & Response:**
```javascript
const detectLanguage = (text) => {
  // Implement language detection
  // Support local languages if needed
};

  // Provide responses in user's preferred language
  const translatedResponse = await translateResponse(response, language);
  return translatedResponse;
};
```

## üìä Data Collection & Improvement

### 1. **Analytics Integration**
```javascript
// Track chatbot usage and effectiveness
const trackChatbotMetrics = {
  totalQueries: 0,
  resolvedQueries: 0,
  popularTopics: {},
  userSatisfaction: [],
  responseTime: []
};

const logInteraction = (query, response, satisfied) => {
  // Store interaction data for improvement
  analytics.track('chatbot_interaction', {
    query: query,
    response_type: response.type,
    user_satisfied: satisfied,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
};
```

### 2. **Feedback Loop**
```javascript
// Implement feedback collection
const collectFeedback = (messageId, rating, suggestion) => {
  // Store feedback for training improvement
  const feedback = {
    messageId,
    rating, // 1-5 stars
    suggestion,
    timestamp: new Date()
  };
  
  // Use feedback to improve responses
